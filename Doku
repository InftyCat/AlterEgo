Given a carpet C
Sign. An atom in C lies at a certain subquotient of C.
Signature. The genus of an atom is either subquotient or uncertainty.
Axiom. The location of an uncertainty atom is always a kernel.
Def. A molecule in C is the combination of two atoms with different genus lying in the same room.



Sign. An atom is either frozen, storing a Goalstate, or it is part of a molecule.
Def. The coparticle of a nonfrozen particle is the other particle in the respective molecule.

Signature. A molecule has the following datum:
    - An eliminator
	- A history: The list of previous states, including the actual state
	- One of its two atoms is leading
    - A molecule can jump in time or can not.



A situation is a carpet with a list of atoms.

Given a situation one has three possibilities to change the situation

a)  Freeze a coparticle
    add a new zero uncertainty coparticle.
    Set the genus of the particle to subquot.
    The eliminator of the new molecule is defined by the frozen atom.
    Set the new molecule to jumpable
b)  If a molecule is in its target, use the eliminator
c) Move a molecule
	- forward in time:
            move both particles in the molecule,
            extend the history of both
            set jumpbable to false
	- If the molecule is jumpable:
        jump backward in time:
        Let u be the uncertainty of the current state
		init the history.
        If the history is now empty, set jumpable to false
        replace the uncertainty of the current state by uncertainty determined by the
        jumpback process and u
      else
        Go to a) and then jump backward in time
d)
